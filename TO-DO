Finish up tilesort glReadPixels pixelstore parameters.

Grep the code for 'XXX' for miscellaneous loose ends.

In state_polygon_gen.c in crStatePolygonSwitch() we need a better test
for updating the polygon stipple.  As-is we're calling diff.PolygonStipple
all the time.

Separate auto-start controls for server and app nodes.

Don't require a program argument in sort-last template.

Sort-last template seems to require all command line args, instead of none.

Wes Bethel:
  While driving the GUI config tool, I started out with a tilesort
  template. On the app node, I added an array SPU before the tilesort
  spu, then save the config file. The config file doesn't contain the
  array spu I asked for. There may be related problems for other
  app-side SPU additions - I've not checked.

Remove #include <math.h> ; create a cr_math.h file instead.
  Wrapper for absf() in server_tiles.c

Rewrite the opengl_stub/defs.py file so that we don't need to manually
update the stack_sizes array.  The sizes should be obtained by calling
apiutil.PacketLength() or something similar.

Check unpacker/unpack.c for unfinished special case functions.

Implement GL_EXT_draw_range_elements extension

In DLM's BindTexture function, record the texture ID with the display
list info so that we know which textures are bound in a list.  Then, in
tilesort, before glCallList, flush (state-diff) all those textures to
be sure the servers' texture are up to date.  We currently flush all
textures prior to glCallList (but that code's disabled).
