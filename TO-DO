  While driving the GUI config tool, I started out with a tilesort
  template. On the app node, I added an array SPU before the tilesort
  spu, then save the config file. The config file doesn't contain the
  array spu I asked for. There may be related problems for other
  app-side SPU additions - I've not checked.
