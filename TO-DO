Clean-up the glFinish/glCopyPixels implementation (don't use glGetInteger)

Finish up tilesort glReadPixels pixelstore parameters.

Implement an error callback facility in packer/pack_error.c so that
errors detected in the packer lib can be handled by the client (such
as the pack SPU.

Some packed pixel formats still aren't implemented in util/pixel.c

Grep the code for 'XXX' for miscellaneous loose ends.

Convert the last two Perl scripts in scripts/fastdep.pl and
state_tracker/gendiffcode.pl to Python. 

Auto-documentation of SPUs.  Encode into the SPU code all the SPU's
options, documentation for the options, whether or not it has a packer,
whether or not it's a terminal SPU, etc.  Write a simple utility to
load an SPU and print its options/docs.  Modify the config tools to
scan for all available SPU libraries and invoke the utility to get
the options/docs for all SPUs.
