# This file lets one set various compile-time options.


# Set RELEASE to 1 to compile with optimizations and without debug info.
RELEASE=0


# Set THREADSAFE to 1 if you want thread safety for parallel applications.
THREADSAFE=0


# Set USE_DMX to 1 if you want to enable DMX support.
# You'll need the libdmx.a library and dmxext.h header in the usual X
# directories.  If you don't, set DMX_INCDIR and DMX_LIBDIR here.
USE_DMX=0
#DMX_DIR=/wherever/DMX/is/installed
#DMX_INCDIR=${DMX_DIR}/dmx/xc/exports/include/
#DMX_LIBDIR=${DMX_DIR}/dmx/xc/exports/lib/


# Set USE_VNC to 1 if you want to enable VNC support.
# You'll need the libVncExt.so.2.0 library and vncstr.h & vnc.h headers in
# the usual X directories. This will build the replicateSPU.
# Note: you'll probably want to turn on threadsafety too (see above).
USE_VNC=0


# Set USE_OSMESA to 1 if you want to enable off screen rendering using Mesa.
USE_OSMESA=0


# Quadrics Elan3 interface support.  There are two different implementations
# of Quadrics communication.  TEAC_SUPPORT is probably what you want;
# TCSCOMM_SUPPORT is somewhat outdated at this point.
TEAC_SUPPORT=0

# Set to 1 to enable Myrinet support

# Set to 1 to enable InfiniBand Support

# Set to 1 to enable DOXYGEN generation
