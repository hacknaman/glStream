# Set USE_DMX to 1 if you want to enable DMX support.
# You'll need the libdmx.a library and dmxext.h header in the usual X
# directories.
USE_DMX=0

# Set USE_VNC to 1 if you want to enable VNC support.
# You'll need the libVncExt.so.2.0 library and vncstr.h & vnc.h headers in

# Note: you'll probably want to turn on threadsafety too (see below).
