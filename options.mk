# This file lets one set various compile-time options.


# Set RELEASE to 1 to compile with optimizations and without debug info.
RELEASE=0


# Set THREADSAFE to 1 if you want thread safety for parallel applications.
THREADSAFE=1


# Set to 1 if you want to force building 32-bit objects on a 64-bit system.
FORCE_32BIT_ABI=0

# Set USE_DMX to 1 if you want to enable DMX support.
# You'll need the libdmx.so (or libdmx.a) library and dmxext.h header in the
# usual X directories.  If you don't, set DMX_INCDIR and DMX_LIB here.
USE_DMX=0
#DMX_INCDIR=/usr/X11R6/include
#DMX_LIB=/usr/X11R6/lib/libdmx.so

# Set USE_REPLICATE to 1 if you want to enable the "replicate" SPU build,
# which can be used with a specially-constructed VNC viewer to use local
# acccelerated rendering to display windows belonging to OpenGL applications.
# You'll need the libVncExt.so.2.0 library and vncstr.h & vnc.h headers in
# the usual X directories.
USE_REPLICATE=0

# Set USE_VNC to 1 if you want to enable the "vnc" SPU build.
# You'll need the libVncExt.so.2.0 library and vncstr.h & vnc.h &
# Xcliplist.h headers in the usual X directories.
USE_VNC=0

# Set USE_XCLIPLIST to 1 if you want the "vnc" SPU build to use
# the XClipList extension.  This is necessary for the Chromium Render
# Server project.  Youll need the libXcliplist.so library and
# the X11/extensions/Xcliplist.h file in the usual X directories.
USE_XCLIPLIST=1

# Set USE_OSMESA to 1 if you want to enable off screen rendering using Mesa.
USE_OSMESA=0


# Quadrics Elan3 interface support.  There are two different implementations
# of Quadrics communication.  TEAC_SUPPORT is probably what you want;
# TCSCOMM_SUPPORT is somewhat outdated at this point.
TEAC_SUPPORT=0

# Set to 1 to enable Myrinet support
GM_SUPPORT=0


# Set to 1 to enable InfiniBand Support
IB_SUPPORT=0

# Set to 1 to enable SDP Support

# Set to 1 to enable DOXYGEN generation

# Netlogger support is in spu/vnc/Makefile
# set NETLOGGER=1 to turn it on
