<p>There are four mailing lists, available from the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=16529" target="new_window">SourceForge
project mailing list page</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="mailto:chromium-announce@lists.sourceforge.net"><b>chromium-announce</b></a>
is for announcements relating to this project.&nbsp; It's very
low-traffic, and everyone should subscribe to this mailing list for
critical update notification, release announcements, etc.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><a href="mailto:chromium-users@lists.sourceforge.net"><b>chromium-users</b></a>
is for users of the system who are not necessarily hacking on the
code.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><a href="mailto:chromium-dev@lists.sourceforge.net"><b>chromium-dev</b>
    </a>is a mailing list for people actively developing the system.
  </li>
  <li><a href="mailto:chromium-checkin@lists.sourceforge.net"><b>chromium-checkin</b></a>
receives mail every time there is a change committed to the CVS
repository, for those of you who want to stay on the very bleeding edge.
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you encounter something that you think isn't working right, you
should file a bug report on the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=116529&amp;group_id=16529&amp;func=browse"
 target="new_window">SourceForge
project bug tracking page</a>.&nbsp; Please browse the existing bugs
first
to make sure you're not submitting a duplicate.</p>
<p>If you don't have a bug, but Chromium doesn't do something you think
it
ought to, you can submit a feature request on the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=366529&amp;group_id=16529&amp;func=browse"
 target="new_window">SourceForge project feature request page</a>.&nbsp;
Feature requests
will (obviously) be lower priority than bugs, but they'll all be taken
seriously.&nbsp; Of course, if you have a feature request, you could
give
thought to implementing it yourself if you have the resources.&nbsp;
This is an
open-source project, after all.&nbsp; Feature additions may be rolled
into the
main source tree on a case-by-case basis.</p>
