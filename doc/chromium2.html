  <p>Over the past few years, progress in consumer graphics card
  capabilities and desktop CPU performance, coupled with advances
  in high-performance networks, have enabled a new generation of
  supercomputer: the commodity graphics cluster. These new
  clusters, built from collections of off-the-shelf Pcs outfitted
  with consumer graphics cards, offer unprecedented power for the
  rendering and display of 3D graphics. However, the application
  programming interface to these systems was not designed for
  parallel clusters. Chromium provides a common parallel graphics
  programming interface to support such clusters. In addition, it
  allows most existing serial applications to run without
  modification, and enables creation of powerful new parallel
  graphics applications capable of fully exploiting the power of
  these clusters.</p>

  <p>Chromium provides a number of key capabilities, uniquely
  combined into a single package</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Streaming graphics pipeline based on the industry standard
    OpenGL API</li>

    <li>Support for multiple physical display devices clustered
    together, such as"powerwall" displays</li>

    <li>Support for aggregation of the output of multiple graphics
    cards to drive a single display at higher levels of
    performance/capability</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Chromium infrastructure has been adopted by a large number
  of users and is rapidly forming the basis of a great deal of
  clustering research. Chromium's capabilities have not only proven
  to be useful on graphics clusters, but the technologies are also
  useful on the single desktop PC.</p>

  <p>This article demonstrates the process of setting up Chromium
  on a cluster and configuring it for use on a tiled display. We
  discuss the important components of the Chromium system and how
  you can configure it for other uses.</p>

  <h2><a name="mozTocId485886" class="mozTocH2" id="mozTocId485886"></a>The Language of Chromium</h2>

  <p>To understand Chromium and how to set it up, you first have to
  understand some basic terminology:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <i>chromium network</i> is a set of <i>nodes</i> arranged
    in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), connected by a network
    interconnect. Most people use TCP/IP, though a number of other
    interconnect APIs are supported.</li>

    <li>A <i>Chromium node is</i> a process that either issues or
    responds to OpenGL commands. It does so by loading a chain of
    <i>spus.</i></li>

    <li><i>spu</i> stands for <i>stream processing unit</i>. It is
    the part of a node that intercepts OpenGL calls and performs
    actions on the OpenGL stream. SPUs are implemented as dynamic
    shared libraries, and generally only implement the smallest
    subset of the OpenGL API required to do useful work.
    Unimplemented calls are passed down the line unmodified. SPUs
    respect an inheritance system, whereby they can inherit and
    override the behaviors of their parents. This makes creating
    new functionality by subclassing existing SPUs very simple.
    Chromium comes with development tools to help template new SPUs
    quickly.</li>

    <li>The "root" of the DAG is called the "app" node. It is where
    OpenGL calls originate. Chromium supports parallel OpenGL
    submission by multiple app nodes, though for space
    considerations, this article will not discuss Chromium
    semaphores and barriers. If you would like to learn more, see
    <a href="http://chromium.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html"><b>doc</b></a>.</li>

    <li>Nodes of the graph that are not app nodes are called
    <span style="font-style: italic;">crservers</span> or just
    servers in Chromium parlance.</li>

    <li>The <span style="font-style: italic;">mothership</span> is
    a Python process that maintains the "map" and configuration of
    the Chromium network. All of the nodes contact the mothership
    for marching orders.</li>

    <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside; list-style-image: none;">
    <br></li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="mozTocId936465" class="mozTocH2" id="mozTocId936465"></a>Getting Chromium</h2>

  <p>Chromium is maintained at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chromium" target="_parent">SourceForge</a>.&nbsp; In addition to the source code,
  you'll also find a bug tracking system and three mailing
  lists.&nbsp; Even if you're not a developer, you may wish to
  subscribe to chromium-announce to receive information about
  updated releases.</p>

  <h3><a name="mozTocId842372" class="mozTocH3" id="mozTocId842372"></a>Obtaining source code</h3>

  <p>To get the source code, you do <i>not</i> have to be a
  registered SourceForge user.&nbsp; You can get the source in one
  of two ways:</p>

  <p>First, you can download the latest release, which is available
  from the <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chromium" target="_parent">main project page</a>, under <b>Latest File
  Releases</b>. This will be a gzip'ed tar file of the entire
  source tree on the release date, along with a copy of this
  documentation.&nbsp; Simply extract the archive and you've got
  everything. For example:</p>
  <pre>      tar zxvf cr-1.7.tar.gz<br>
</pre>or
  <pre>      gzcat cr-1.7.tar.gz | tar xvf -<br>
</pre>

  <p>Alternately, you can check out the top-of-tree source code
  from the CVS repository, if you want to live on the bleeding
  edge. To check out the source code, just follow the instructions
  on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=16529" target="_parent">CVS repository page</a>. If you're unfamiliar
  with CVS, useful documentation is available in <i><a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html" target="_parent">Open
  Source Development with CVS</a></i>. If you want to track the CVS
  sources you should subscribe to the developers and CVS check-in
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=16529" target="_parent">mailing lists</a>. That's where new development is
  discussed.</p>

  <h3><a name="mozTocId55264" class="mozTocH3" id="mozTocId55264"></a>Prerequisites</h3>

  <p>You will need <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_parent">Python 2.2</a> or later, and <a href="http://www.perl.org" target="_parent">Perl 5.0</a> or later to
  build on any platform.</p>

  <p>You'll need GLUT installed so that the demonstration programs
  will compile.</p>

  <h3><a name="mozTocId483731" class="mozTocH3" id="mozTocId483731"></a>Compiling the source</h3>

  <p>All of Chromium lives under a directory called
  "<code>cr-X.Y</code>" (where X.Y is the version). Change to that
  directory.</p>

  <p>There are a few compile-time options that can be specified in
  the <code>options.mk</code> file. DMX support and threadsafety
  options are specified in this file, for example. If you have
  Myrinet or Quadrics network hardware, you can enable those
  interfaces here. At least initially, you shouldn't have to change
  anything in this file.</p>

  <p>To start compilation, just type "<code>make</code>" (or
  <code>gmake</code> on some systems).</p>

  <p>Binaries are put in <code>cr-X.Y/bin/&lt;ARCH&gt;</code>,
  where <code>&lt;ARCH&gt;</code> is the name of your architecture
  (Actually, it's what's returned by the "<code>uname</code>"
  command. Except on Windows, where <a href="http://cygwin.com/" target="_parent">cygwin's</a> "<code>uname</code>" returns
  something long and silly, so it gets re-written to
  "<code>WIN_NT</code>".). You should add this directory to your
  <code>PATH</code> environment variable.</p>

  <p>Platform specific notes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Any UNIX</b>: Shared libraries will be put in the
    directory <code>cr-X.Y/lib/&lt;ARCH&gt;</code>. You will need
    to add this directory to your <code style="font-weight: bold;">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code><span style="font-weight: bold;">
    </span>environment variable. Chromium builds a <i>lot</i> of shared
    libraries, so you can't skip this step.</li>

    <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside; list-style-image: none;">
    <br></li>

    <li><b>Windows</b>: You will also need to install the <a href="http://cygwin.com/" target="_parent">cygwin tools</a> to build
    Chromium. If you're building from the Windows shell (as opposed
    to the cygwin bash implementation), you will need to set the
    environment variable <span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span><code style="font-weight: bold;">MAKE_MODE</code><span style="font-weight: bold;">"</span> to the string
    "<code>unix</code>". This lets <code>gmake</code> use
    <code>bash</code> as its subshell instead of the Windows shell,
    which is required. Shared libraries on Windows get put in
    <code>cr-X.Y/bin/WIN_NT</code>, which (since it's on your path,
    right?) will be searched automatically, so there's no
    <code style="font-weight: bold;">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>silliness.</li>

    <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside; list-style-image: none;">
    <br></li>

    <li><b>IRIX</b>: GNU make is required. Build Chromium by typing
    <code>gmake</code> instead of <code>make</code>.</li>

    <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside; list-style-image: none;">
    <br></li>

    <li><b>AIX</b>: Shared libraries are somewhat different on this
    platform. For Cr clients and servers to run, a dlopen-able
    system GL is needed. At present, do this (once) manually (ar -x
    /usr/lib/libGL.a &amp;&amp; mv shr.o libGL.o ) . Set
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">CR_SYSTEM_GL_PATH</span> to the directory with libGL.o for AIX clients
    and servers.<br>
    The exec loader will continue to look for .a's (rather, shared
    objects in ar archives) and .so's. So to run clients without
    the app_faker, prepend <span style="font-weight: bold;">LIBPATH</span> with a dir that has a link
    libGL.a -&gt; lib/AIX/libcrfaker.a . As with other platforms,
    you also need to set the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CR_APPLICATION_ID_NUMBER.</span></li>

    <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside; list-style-image: none;">
    <br></li>

    <li><b>SunOS</b>: OpenGL apps must be compiled with
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUN_OGL_NO_VERTEX_MACROS</span> defined so that macros aren't used for
    OpenGL API functions. This also means that Sun's stock GLUT and
    GLU libraries won't work with Chromium. After you've produced
    new GLUT and GLU libraries you may have to edit SunOS.mk and
    modify your <span style="font-weight: bold;">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span> to select the new libraries.<br>
    There seems to be a bug in the version of Xsun that comes with
    Solaris 9. To go around it set <span style="font-weight: bold;">SOLARIS_9_X_BUG.</span> Even if you're
    compiling say the Linux version but are using a sun for the
    display you should set this.</li>

    <li style="list-style-type: none; list-style-position: outside; list-style-image: none;">
    <br></li>

    <li><b>Darwin</b>: Support for this operating system is not
    complete. Only GLX applications work at the moment.  You need the
    following to get Chromium to compile on the Mac:
      <ul>
	<li>X11 and the X11 SDK from Apple</li>
	<li>An X11 version of glut (you can get this from <a
	href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</a>)</li>
	<li>Xcode</li>
    </ul>
    Use <b>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> instead of <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>.
    Make sure that <b>LD_PREBIND</b>
    and <b>LD_PREBIND_ALLOW_OVERLAP</b> are <b>NOT</b> set.
    Other <b>LD</b> variables may interfere with the build process. 
  </ul><br>

  <h3><a name="mozTocId518358" class="mozTocH3" id="mozTocId518358"></a>Special Notes</h3>

  <h4><a name="mozTocId424298" class="mozTocH4" id="mozTocId424298"></a>NVIDIA drivers with Red Hat Linux</h4>

  <p>Firstly, NVIDIA's OpenGL header files (gl.h and glext.h) are
  somewhat broken. Just don't use them! If you accidentally install
  NVIDIA's header files in /usr/include/GL you should replace them
  with the stock XFree86 OpenGL headers or the headers included
  with Mesa.</p>

  <p>If you're using RedHat Linux 9.0 (or later?) with NVIDIA
  hardware/drivers you'll probably have to set the
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">CR_SYSTEM_GL_PATH</span> environment variable to
  <code>/usr/lib/tls</code></p>

  <p>This causes Chromium to use the libGL.so library found in
  /usr/lib/tls/ instead of /usr/lib/, thus avoiding some
  thread-related problems.</p>

  <h4><a name="mozTocId34273" class="mozTocH4" id="mozTocId34273"></a>Additional Compiler Optimizations</h4>

  <p>Look at the <code>cr-X.Y/config/Linux.mk</code> for some
  additional gcc compiler flags that can increase performance on
  x86 Linux systems.</p><br>

  <h2><a name="mozTocId651901" class="mozTocH2" id="mozTocId651901"></a>Compiling Chromium</h2>Once you download and
  uncompress the Chromium tarball, you'll want to explore the
  documentation. All documentation for Chromium lives in the
  <a href="http://chromium.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html"><b>doc</b></a>
  directory. Load up <a href="#Introduction_to_Chromium_"><b>doc</b></a> in a web browser and
  wander around. Some pages that you'll find useful later on while
  configuring motherships are <a href="http://chromium.sourceforge.net/doc/configoptions.html">Provided
  SPUs and configuration options</a> , <a href="http://chromium.sourceforge.net/doc/configserver.html">Configuration
  options for server nodes</a>, and <a href="http://chromium.sourceforge.net/doc/configapp.html">Configuration
  options for app nodes</a>. More on these options later.<br>

  <p>Chromium's build system is entirely GNU make based. Thus, all
  that's generally required is a <b>make</b>. No <b>configure</b>
  needed. The build system works under Cygwin as well, though
  Windows is less supported and tested than Linux. The build
  doesn't take too long (just over 5 minutes on a 2Ghz Xeon).<br>
  Some build options are specified in <b>options.mk</b>. The most
  important one is <b>RELEASE</b> Set that to 0 if you want to turn
  on debugging symbols and turn off optimization. You definitely
  should do this if there's something going wrong.<br>
  <br>
  Support for different network interconnects can be found in util.
  (These options have been moved into <b style="font-weight: bold;">options.mk</b> in Chromium releases after
  1.7.) Set <b>TEAC_SUPPORT</b> to compile in Quadrics support,
  <b>GM_SUPPORT</b> if you have a Myrinet interconnect, and
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">IB_SUPPORT</span> if you have
  Infiniband. For SDP support set<span style="font-weight: bold;"> SDP_SUPPORT</span> to 1. No matter what you set in <b>util</b>, TCP/IP support
  is always included.<br>
  <br>
  Some miscellaneous options in <b>options.mk</b> that might also
  be useful are <b>USE_DMX</b> and <b>USE_OSMESA</b>.
  <b>USE_DMX</b> turns on support for automatic detection and use
  of the Distributed Multihead X Server. See the "DMX" sidebar for
  more information. <b>USE_OSMESA</b> compiles Chromium to do
  off-screen rendering with the software-based Mesa 3D graphics
  library. <span style="font-weight: bold;">THREADSAFE </span>may be set to 1 if you want thread safety for parallel applications.</p>
<p>If you have doxygen and want to generate doxygen'ed source code documentation you can set <span style="font-weight: bold;">DOXYGEN</span> to 1.</p>
<p>
  Before you <b>make</b>, be sure you have the required
  dependencies. Chromium requires Python version 2.2 or greater. It
  also expects to find an OpenGL installation and the GLUT toolkit
  in the standard places. If you want to run the optional graphical
  configuration tool (more on this later), you'll also need
  wxPython installed. To test that your build succeeded and
  everything is working, let's run a simple Chromium network.
  First, familiarize yourself with where the build system placed
  everything:</p>


  <ul>
    <li><b style="font-family: monospace;">lib/&lt;os&gt;</b>: All
    libraries and SPUs are placed in here.</li>

    <li><b style="font-family: monospace;">bin/&lt;os&gt;</b> All
    executables live here. This is useful to place in your
    <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>. (The rest of this article assumes it's in
    your <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> for brevity.)</li>

    <li><b style="font-family: monospace;">build</b>: This is a
    temporary directory only used during the build process.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Chromium provides a number of test programs for various
  purposes. These can be very useful to run when starting out, or
  when debugging a recalcitrant Chromium network. Their source
  (found in the <b>progs</b> directory) is also invaluable as
  reference when writing applications that use Chromium. Some
  important programs are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">city</span>: Good for
    testing display lists and textures</li>

    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">atlantis</span>: An
    extremely simple program that has sharks and whales swimming
    around.</li>

    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">spheres</span>: This
    one is good for characterizing triangle rendering
    performance</li>

    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">psubmit</span>: An
    example of parallel OpenGL geometry submission.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We're going to run atlantis with the simple <b style="font-style: italic;">crdemo</b>, found with the pre-packaged
  configuration files. Head over to the <b style="font-style: italic;">mothership</b> directory and run a
  mothership along with two Chromium nodes:<br></p>

  <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">1: % cd
  mothership/config</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">2: % python crdemo.conf
  atlantis &amp;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">3: % crserver
  &amp;</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">4: % crappfaker<br>
  <br></span> You should get two windows, one blank, one with fish.
  Congratulations, you've run your first Chromium network!
  Everything else is downhill from here.</p>

  <p>Let's go through those commands, line by line, to understand
  what's going on. First, we head into the <b style="font-style: italic;">mothership</b>directory where all the
  configuration files are stored. Line 2 runs a mothership
  configured by the code in <b>crdemo.conf</b>. The network has two
  nodes, an app node and a server node. The app node merely
  forwards requests on to the server. The server opens its own
  render window and renders all requests into it. The mothership
  listens on port 10000 and waits for the nodes to contact it. Line
  3 launches a Chromium server. It contacts the mothership and
  learns its place in the network. Line 4 launches Chromium's
  <i style="font-weight: bold;">appfaker</i>, which "tricks" the
  runtime loader into loading Chromium instead of the system's
  OpenGL library. When atlantis is launched, Chromium intercepts
  all of its OpenGL commands and packs them onto the network. The
  server receives the commands, unpacks them, and renders them to
  its own window. It is important to note that Chromium dynamically
  replaces a system's native OpenGL library with its own library
  when the application is executed. Because of this, Chromium can
  be used by almost any existing OpenGL application without
  modification.</p>

  <h2><a name="mozTocId916679" class="mozTocH2" id="mozTocId916679"></a> Mothership configuration files</h2>If you
  want to start doing something more complicated (and who
  wouldn't?), the place to start exploring is the mothership
  configuration file. Chromium comes with a wealth of existing
  configuration files in the <b style="font-style: italic;">mothership</b> directory. Many times, you
  can accomplish what you want by copying and modifying one of
  these existing files.

  <p>Each Chromium network has one configuration file. This file
  describes everything that is associated with a given Chromium
  run: DAG nodes and edges; what SPUs are loaded by what servers;
  what options are specified for the servers, SPUs, app nodes; what
  type of network should be used; what view frustum each server
  should use; etc.</p>

  <p>All configuration files are actually Python scripts. This
  provides an immense amount of power, since Chromium
  configurations can adapt themselves to changing requirements. All
  Python constructs are allowed, providing a wealth of options to
  the Chromium user.</p>

  <p>Chromium networks are defined by instantiating Python classes
  that correspond to the various elements of the Chromium system,
  app nodes, server nodes, and SPUs. They are connected to each
  other through method calls, and joined together at the end into
  one system.</p><br>

  <h3><a name="mozTocId98932" class="mozTocH3" id="mozTocId98932"></a>Listing One -- A simple configuration
  file</h3><br>
  Listing 1 shows a simple, yet useful, configuration file.<br>
  Lines 1-3 are there so that Python knows where to find the Python
  classes for the mothership.<br>

  <p>Things start getting interesting at line 5, where the
  <i>render</i> SPU is instantiated. This is the SPU that takes all
  OpenGL commands and feeds them to the graphics card. It generally
  opens up its own window. Most times, you want at least one of
  these at the end of your DAG, though there are other uses. Lines
  6-7 show how you configure something. All Chromium classes have
  the same <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conf</span> member
  function to set configuration parameters. Here, we're telling the
  <i>render</i> SPU to resize its window to 512 by 192 pixels and
  locate it in the upper left corner of the screen. At line 9 we
  instantiate another SPU, the <i>hiddenline</i> SPU, which causes
  all polygons to be drawn in a solid color, with their edges drawn
  in black.</p>

  <p>The default line width of 3 is a little thick, so at line 10
  we reduce it down to 1 pixel wide.</p>

  <p>Now that we have the SPUs created and configured, on line 12
  we create a <b>CRApplicationNode</b>. We add the SPUs to the node
  in order on lines 13 and 14, then tell the app node what
  application to run on lines 15-16. In this case, we want it to
  run the stock <span style="font-family: monospace;">atlantis</span> application with 100
  sharks. <b>CRApplicationNode.</b></p>

  <p>Finally, we create the master <b>cr</b> object on line 18.
  Only one of these can exist, since it contains the entire
  Chromium network. We add the one and only node on line 19, and
  set the mothership <b>go</b>ing on line 20.</p><br>
  <img src="hiddenline.jpg" alt="Figure One - Hiddenline Fish" style="width: 512px; height: 192px;"><br>
  <br>
  <img src="normal.jpg" alt="Figure Two - Normal Fish" style="width: 512px; height: 192px;" align="middle"><br>
  <br>

  <p>A screen shot of this network in action can be seen in Figure
  1. Note how the fish look in comparison to those in Figure 2,
  which was run with the same configuration but without the
  <i>hiddenline</i> SPU.</p>

  <h2><a name="mozTocId997188" class="mozTocH2" id="mozTocId997188"></a> The Graphical Configuration File
  Editor</h2>Understanding that these configuration files can
  sometimes be difficult to write, especially if one is unfamiliar
  with Chromium configuration file syntax, or through inexperience
  with Python, one of the Chromium developers provided a GUI for
  creating, viewing, and editing the configuration files.

  <p>You can find it at <b style="font-style: italic;">mothership</b>. As mentioned above, it
  requires wxPython be installed.</p><br>
  <a href="configtool.tiff"><img src="configtool.jpg" alt="Figure Three - Graphical Configuration File Editor" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 707px; height: 236px;" align="middle"></a><br>

  <p>A screenshot of the Config Tool can be seen in Figure 3,
  displaying the <b>crdemo</b> file that we first ran. The Chromium
  network is displayed from left to right, each node displayed as a
  box connected to other nodes, as appropriate. App nodes are
  green, server nodes are red. SPUs are shown as gray boxes inside
  of the nodes. While we won't get into detail about this editor
  here, know that you can edit all options of the nodes, the SPUs,
  and the Chromium system as a whole from inside the editor. In
  addition,there are templates for common operations like
  "sort-first" and "sort-last" rendering. For more advanced use of
  the Config tool, see the <a href="configtool.html">Graphical
  Config tool</a> page.<br></p>

  <h2><a name="mozTocId913616" class="mozTocH2" id="mozTocId913616"></a> Rendering to a Tiled Display</h2>Many
  applications of Chromium are to leverage a "powerwall", or tiled
  display. In this setup, multiple monitors or projectors are
  stacked to form a larger "virtual" display. This discussion
  specifically excludes CAVE-style systems, though Chromium is
  capable of rendering to these with additional configuration
  options.<br>
  <br>
  Chromium comes with a bevy of useful SPUs, "plugins" that let you
  manipulate the OpenGL stream in various ways.<br>
  <a name="Here_are_some_of_the_most_useful_SPUs:" id="Here_are_some_of_the_most_useful_SPUs:"></a>Here are some of the
  most useful SPUs:

  <ul>
    <li><i style="font-family: monospace;">render</i>: Sends all
    geometry to the system's OpenGL library for rendering. This is
    one of the major workhorses of Chromium.</li>

    <li><i style="font-family: monospace;">print</i>: Writes an
    ASCII version of all OpenGL calls to a file. Extremely useful
    for debugging an OpenGL application.</li>

    <li><i style="font-family: monospace;">tilesort</i><span style="font-family: monospace;">:</span> Does a "sort-first"
    partition of the geometry and sends it to multiple downstream
    servers, each of which occupies some subset of the total
    "virtual" screen space. The <i style="font-family: monospace;">tilesort</i> SPU calculates the
    projected bounding box of each group of geometry, determines
    which servers the bounding box overlaps, and only sends the
    necessary pieces downstream.</li>

    <li><i style="font-family: monospace;">readback</i>: A subclass
    of the <i style="font-family: monospace;">render</i> SPU which
    reads the frame buffer and/or depth buffer back into memory and
    sends them downstream by way of <b>glDrawPixels</b> In
    essence, the <i style="font-family: monospace;">readback</i>
    SPU converts an OpenGL stream of geometry into a stream of
    imagery.</li>

    <li><i style="font-family: monospace;">binaryswap</i>: Does a
    "sort-last" composite. This is a subclass of the <i style="font-family: monospace;">render</i> SPU, that does out of band
    communication of the resultant imagery to implement the
    well-known <i>binary swap</i> method of depth compositing.</li>

    <li><i style="font-family: monospace;">perf</i>: Collects
    performance statistics. There is a separate documentation page
    about this SPU found in <a href="http://chromium.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html"><b>doc</b></a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In the most basic configuration, a Chromium server is started
  on each node connected to a "tile" of the tiled display. One app
  node is connected to all of the servers through the <i style="font-family: monospace;">tilesort</i> SPU. (<a href="#Here_are_some_of_the_most_useful_SPUs:">See Useful SPUs</a>) As
  geometry is fed from the app node to the <i style="font-family: monospace;">tilesort</i>SPU, the SPU determines
  what geometry overlaps each tile. Each set of geometry is sent
  only to the tiles it overlaps, making for efficient transfer of
  the scene.</p>

  <p>For brevity, only the section setting up the <span style="font-family: monospace;">tilesort</span> and the nodes is
  shown.</p>1: TILE_WIDTH = 1280<br>

  <a name="mozTocId501322" class="mozTocH3" id="mozTocId501322"></a>Listing Two -- Tiled display configuration
  file

  <p>Listing 2 shows a mothership configuration file that describes
  a tiled display in a 2x1 configuration of uniformly-sized tiles.
  Other similar configuration files are <b>mural.conf</b> and
  <b>wall.conf</b>. Let's walk through this listing.</p>

  <p>Lines 1-2 describes how big each individual tile is. Here
  we're assuming a tile size of 1280x1024, a common screen
  size.</p>

  <p>Lines 4-8 set up the app node. Note the parameter to the
  <b>CRApplicationNode</b> call: the is the name of the machine on
  which the node will run. This lets you lay out the Chromium
  network to correspond to your cluster.</p>

  <p>The <i>tilesort</i> SPU is instantiated and added to the app
  node.</p>

  <p>Now comes the interesting part.</p>

  <p>Line 10 iterates over both tiles.</p>

  <p>Lines 11-12 create a <i>render</i> SPU and set it to run
  fullscreen. Since each node drives a separate tile, this is
  exactly what we want to fully use the tiled display.</p>

  <p>Lines 14 creates the server node. Again, note the parameter
  that names the machine on which the node lives. Lines 15-16 tell
  Chromium where in virtual screen space this particular node
  lies.</p>

  <p>And line 17 adds the <i>render</i> SPU to the server node.</p>

  <p>Lines 19-21 tell the <i>tilesort</i> SPU how to contact the
  server. Each node listens on a separate TCP/IP port. While this
  isn't necessary when all nodes live on different machines, as
  this example shows, it is important if you have more than one
  node on a single processor. Finally, line 23 adds the node to the
  Chromium system. With a mothership in place with this
  configuration, all that's needed is to start <b>crserver</b>s on
  both back-end nodes, and start the application with
  <b>crappfaker</b>. The <b>crserver</b>s should be pointed to the
  location of the mothership. If we started the mothership on
  <i>machine0</i>, say, then a <b>crserver</b> should be launched
  with: <b>crserver -mothership= machine0:10000</b>, specifying
  both the machine and the port number of the mothership.
  Alternately, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CRMOTHERSHIP </span>environment variable can be
  used for the same purpose.</p>

  <p>This can get tedious if there are a lot of tiles in the tiled
  display and many server need to be launched. Fortunately,
  Chromium has the ability to start the <b>crserver</b>s
  automatically, though ssh, rsh, or other mechanisms. See the
  description of the <b>autostart</b> command at the bottom of
  <a href="http://chromium.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html"><b>doc</b></a>.</p>

  <p>Another option for tiled displays is running the <i style="font-weight: bold;">distributed multihead x11</i> (DMX) system.
  See the "<a href="#DMX">DMX"</a> for more information. Chromium
  can be compiled to automatically detect and use <a href="#DMX">DMX</a> capabilities, automatically launching <b style="font-style: italic;">crserver</b>s on the back-end nodes,
  providing for a seamless and scalable tiled display experience
  for end users. We at LLNL have found this to be an ideal union of
  technologies.</p>

  <p>In some cases, using <b>crappfaker</b> to launch your OpenGL
  application can be cumbersome due to application launching
  constraints. In this case, you need to replicate manually what
  <b>crappfaker</b> does for you. Execute the following commands
  (Linux illustrated here):</p>

  <p>% cd lib/Linux<br>
  % ln -s libcrfaker.so libGL.so.1<br>
  % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH <b>chromium</b>/lib/Linux<br>
  <br>
  On Linux, the standard system OpenGL is named <b>libgl.so.1</b>.
  Other Oses have different, but similar, names. The Chromium
  library that resolves the OpenGL API and starts the ball rolling
  is its "faker" library, <b>libcrfaker.so</b>. Placing the
  Chromium <b>lib/os</b> directory in the <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>
  causes the runtime linker to find the Chromium faker library
  instead of the System's OpenGL. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">LD_PRELOAD</span> environment variable can
  also be useful for this purpose. With this setup, you can launch
  your OpenGL application normally. Many people use this launch
  method exclusively, relying on <b>crappfaker</b> in only rare
  circumstances.<br>
  <br></p>

  <p><b>DMX Distributed X11 Server Providing a Single, Continuous
  Desktop Over Six XFree86 Servers</b><br clear="all">
<br clear="all">
<br>
DMX is a proxy X server that controls multiple back-end X servers
  that make up a tiled display. To an application, DMX appears as a
  normal X server. All X11 requests are directed to the appropriate
  back-end X server for resolution.DMX contains a GLX
  implementation called GLXProxy. This implementation is a
  broadcast-only system, meaning that all OpenGL requests are sent
  to all back-end servers. While this is not scalable to large
  numbers of back-end servers, it does provide capability and
  usefulness for smaller tiled displays.</p>

  <p>Chromium bridges the gap to larger displays. It detects DMX
  and queries the name and location of the back-end X servers. It
  then sets up the <i>tilesort</i> SPU to communicate with the
  back-end servers directly, bypassing DMX. Using <b>autostart</b>,
  Chromium can also be set up to automatically spawn a mothership
  and the back-end <b>crserver</b>s on the nodes. As the DMX window
  is moved and resized, Chromium recomputes the tile layout for the
  <i>tilesort</i>er and the servers. A movie showing a tiled
  display running in this mode is available at the URL shown at the
  bottom of the <a href="#Resources">Resources section</a>.<br>
  For more information in running DMX, see <a href="http://dmx.sourceforge.net/dmx-start.html">Getting started with
  DMX.</a><br></p>

  <h2><a name="mozTocId214849" class="mozTocH2" id="mozTocId214849"></a>What if it's not working ?<br></h2>Chromium
  works with a large number of applications, clusters, and network
  configurations, but it's not foolproof. Sometimes an application
  that works just fine outside of Chromium will display strange
  results when Chromium is added to the mix. Other times, the
  introduction of a tiled display can reveal artifacts. This
  section is a laundry list of things to try when Chromium isn't
  acting the way you expect.

  <p>First, try out some of the test applications that come with
  Chromium. Use your Chromium network, but run <i>atlantis</i> or
  <i>city</i> instead. If your application is parallel, you might
  try the <i>psubmit</i> application. If a test application works,
  then the problem probably has to do with the way your application
  makes OpenGL calls.</p>

  <p>Chromium has primarily been developed and debugged on Linux
  and other UNIX platforms. While it does work on Windows, there
  are known problems. Most notably, display lists are problematic.
  If at all possible, try using Linux instead.</p>

  <p>If you're experiencing trouble, be sure to compile Chromium
  with the <b>RELEASE</b> option in <b style="font-weight: bold;">options</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">.mk</span> turned off. This will enable
  extra debugging information that can be useful in times of
  trouble. Chromium can be extremely verbose in this mode, but
  sometimes the warning messages will tell you something helpful.
  Additionally, setting the <b>CR_DEBUG</b> environment variable
  causes some extra warnings to be printed to standard error.</p>

  <p>If your application uses OpenGL selection or feedback, you
  have be sure to add the <i>feedback</i> SPU to your network. This
  SPU implements those features.</p>

  <p>Try inserting the <i>print</i> SPU into your network at
  various points. As mentioned in the "Useful SPUs" sidebar, the
  <i>print</i> SPU writes a human-readable version of the OpenGL
  stream to a file. This can be valuable if you aren't entirely
  sure what's in the stream. More than one <i>print</i> SPU can
  help determine how the stream is being processed through the
  pipeline.</p>

  <p>The problem might have to do with interaction with your
  vendor's OpenGL driver. Try using Mesa instead of the system's
  OpenGL, and set the <b>MESA_DEBUG</b> environment variable to
  print warnings to standard error. Try increasing the size of the
  global Chromium MTU. This has implications for the network layers
  of Chromium. The optimum setting is dependent on your switch
  fabric, though this is a bit of black magic. Sometimes this can
  "magically" fix problems with <i>tilesort</i>.<br></p>

  <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">cr =
  CR()</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">cr.MTU(1024*1024)</span><br></p>

  <p>If you're having problems with the <i>tilesort</i>er, try
  setting it to "broadcast" mode. In this mode, all geometry is
  sent to all tiles, regardless of layout:<br></p>

  <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">tilesort =
  SPU("tilesort")</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">tilesort.Conf("bucket_mode",
  "broadcast")<br></span></p>

  <p><span style="font-family: monospace;">For other problems try
  the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ.</a><br></span></p>

  <p>If all else fails, try the mailing lists. Chromium developers
  are generally pretty good about helping people. The Chromium
  User's list is <a href="mailto:chromium-users@lists.sourceforge.net"><b>chromium-users@lists.sourceforge.net</b></a>
  and the Chromium Developer's list is <a href="mailto:chromium-dev@lists.sourceforge.net"><b>chromium-dev@lists.sourceforge.net</b></a>.
  Be sure to have tried some simple apps like atlantis and city
  first. You should also include your mothership configuration file
  so that people can understand how your network is laid
  out.<br></p>
