<h1 class="PageHeading">Using Chromium with DMX</h1>
<p>
<A HREF="http://dmx.sourceforge.net/" target="_parent">DMX</A>
allows X to be run on a cluster of systems such that the X display/desktop
can span many individual screens.
For example, a cluster of 12 computers running X can be harnessed to provide
a large tiled display of 4 x 3 screens.
Windows can span screen boundaries.
</p>

<p>
Needless to say, DMX works with X-based systems; not Windows.
</p>

<p>
Since version 1.2, Chromium has support for DMX so that OpenGL applications
can work transparently on a DMX display.
</p>

<p>
Previously, when Chromium's tilesort SPU was used to drive a large, tiled
display there were a number of problems:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The original application window was created but left empty while
    Chromium rendered to the back-end screens.
<li>Mouse-based interaction was difficult because the pointer wasn't
    visible with the Chromium rendering.
<li>Only one OpenGL window was supported.
</ul>

<p>
These problems are now fixed for DMX displays since Chromium directly
renders into the real X windows.
In short, OpenGL applications "just work" the way you'd expect.
</p>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Setup</h2>

<p>
You should already have DMX up and running on your graphics cluster.
See the <HREF="http://dmx.sourceforge.net/" target="_parent">
DMX documentation</A> for instructions.
</p>

<p>
Furtheremore, you'll need to copy the <code>dmxext.h</code> header file
from <code>dmx/xc/include/extensions/dmxext.h</code> into your usual X
header file directory, such as <code>/usr/X11R6/include/X11/extensions</code>.
Then, the DMX client library, <code>libdmx.a</code> should be copied from
<code>dmx/build/xc/exports/lib/libdmx.a</code> to your usual X library
directory, such as <code>/usr/X11R6/lib</code>.
</p>

<p>
You'll need to compile Chromium with DMX support.  To do this, edit
<code>cr/config/Linux.mk</code> (or another config file for your system)
and set <code>USE_DMX=1</code>.
</p>

<p>
Then, rebuild Chromium by doing <code>make clean</code>
followed by <code>make</code>.
</p>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Running Manually</h2>

<p>
Edit the sample <code>mothership/config/dmx.conf</code> configuration script -
you'll have to edit the TILE_ROWS, TILE_COLS and HOSTS settings, at least.
</p>

<p>
Start the mothership:  <code>python dmx.conf appname</code>
</p>
<p>
On each of the back-end systems:
<ul>
<li>open a shell.
<li>set the DISPLAY env var to the native X display (i.e. "cluster7:0")
<li>set the CRMOTHERSHIP env var to the host where the mothership is running.
<li>set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env var to your Chromium lib directory
<li>start a crserver
</ul>

On the DMX front-end system:
<ul>
<li>open a shell
<li>set the DISPLAY env var to the DMX server (i.e. "frontend:1")
<li>set the CRMOTHERSHIP env var to the host where the mothership is running.
<li>set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env var to your Chromium lib directory
<li>start a crappfaker
</ul>
</p>

<p>
At this point, your OpenGL application should be running on DMX.
</p>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Running with Auto-start</h2>

<p>
Ideally, one would like to able to start an OpenGL application in the normal
manner and have it use DMX+Chromium automatically, without manually starting
a mothership and set of crservers as we did above.
The auto-start feature lets you do just that.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<ol>
<li>Your ~/.crsite file needs to be setup (or $CRSITE or /etc/crsite).
<br>
<br>
<li>Your ~/.crconfigs file needs to be setup.  Specifically, it needs a
    line like this:
    <pre>
    *  /usr/local/Chromium/cr/mothership/configs/autodmx.conf %m %p
    </pre>
    This tells Chromium's libcrfaker to use the autodmx.conf config file
    when running any application (indicated by *).  The %m is replaced by
    a random mothership port.  The %p is replaced by the program name.
<br>
<br>
<li>libGL.so and libGL.so.1 must be symlink to libcrfaker.so
<br>
<br>
<li>The back-end/cluster machines must have the crserver binary in the
    search path (typically /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin) and a properly
    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (you can tweak it below).
<br>
<br>
<li>rsh to the back-end/cluster machines must work.
<br>
<br>
<li>You may need to tweak the value of 'crdir' in the autodmx.conf file.
</ol>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<ol>
<li>When the app starts, libcrfaker will fail to find the mothership on
     its first try.  That'll signal it to search the .crconfigs file for
     a mothership config to spawn.  libcrfaker will choose a random port
     number for the mothership.
<br>
<br>
<li>The mothership is spawned with autodmx.conf.  In turn, it uses rsh
    to start up the crservers on the back-end machines.  Another random
    port number is used for the crservers.
<br>
<br>
<li>Control returns to libcrfaker where it proceeds to load the client-side
    SPU chain (tilesort).  Then, control returns to the application.
</ol>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>
The auto-start code is a bit rough and may not work reliably at this time.
</p>




<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Configuration Details</h2>

<p>
The dmx.conf file is an example configuration for using Chromium with DMX.
If you decide to change it or make your own configuration file
there are a few critical settings to be aware of.
</p>

<p>
The client/application node must be configured to track window size and
position changes:
</p>
<pre>
     clientnode.Conf('track_window_size', 1)
     clientnode.Conf('track_window_position', 1)
</pre>

<p>
The tilesort SPU must be set to use DMX:
</p>
<pre>
     tilesortspu.Conf('use_dmx', 1)
</pre>

<p>
The best bucketing mode to use is 'Non-Uniform Grid'.  The 'Uniform Grid'
mode can't be used since it's extremely rare for a window to be subdivided
into identical tiles.
</p>
<pre>
     tilesortspu.Conf('bucket_mode', 'Non-Uniform Grid')
</pre>

<p>
The server/network node must be configured to use DMX.  Optimized bucketing
is of no use and should be disabled.
</p>
<pre>
     servernode.Conf('use_dmx', 1)
     servernode.Conf('optimize_bucket', 0)
</pre>

<p>
The server's render SPUs should be configured to render into the application
window and the SPUs needs to know the appropriate X display for the back-end
X servers:
</p>
<pre>
     renderspu.Conf('render_to_app_window', 1)
     renderspu.Conf('display_string', HOSTS[n] + ":0")
</pre>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>
If compilation fails, be sure the dmxext.h header is in the right place
(see above).
</p>

<p>
If everything's working correctly you should see "GL_CR_dmx" in the list
of OpenGL extensions listed by the <code>glxinfo</code> program.
</p>

<p>
If you're using NVIDIA's OpenGL drivers and are experiencing poor performance
on the DMX display it may be because you're using too much VRAM and falling
back to software rendering.
This inadvertantly happens because the render SPU may be creating GLX windows
that are never used.
A simple solution to this problem is to set the render SPU's default window
size very small, say 2x2 pixels.
See the <code>dmx.conf</code> file for details.
</p>

<p>
More to come...
</p>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">How Chromium Works with DMX</h2>

<p>
Each of the back-end systems runs a crserver.
Each crserver has a render SPU.
</p>
<p>
The mothership is configured for a crNetworkNode (crserver) on each
back-end server.
A tilesort SPU is configured for the front-end application (crappfaker).
</p>
<p>
Chromium's libGL faker loads the tilesort SPU.
When a new OpenGL window is created, the tilesort SPU uses the DMX extension
to find the window information on the back-end X servers which corresponds
to the new X window.
The tilesort SPU directs the N back-end render SPUs to directly draw into the
back-end windows.
</p>
<p>
Whenever the DMX OpenGL window is moved or resized the tilesort SPU recomputes
a new tiling and sends that information to the backend crservers.
</p>
