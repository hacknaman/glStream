                   How to make a Chromium release
                 (on Linux, using 1.6 as an example)



Coding
======

Update include/cr_version.h with new version numbers.

Update mothership/server/mothership.py and update "Version".

Bump version in mothership/tools/graph.py if the graphical config tool
has been updated since last release.



Make the tarballs
=================

mkdir Chromium-1.6
cd Chromium-1.6
cvs -z3 -d:ext:YOURNAME@cvs.chromium.sf.net:/cvsroot/chromium co .
cp -r cr cr-1.6
find cr-1.6 -name CVS -exec rm -rf '{}' \;
rm -f cr-1.6/mothership/server/crconfig.py
Edit cr-1.6/options.mk and uncomment the RELEASE=1 line.
tar cf cr-1.6.tar cr-1.6
gzip cr-1.6.tar

zip -r cr-1.6.zip cr-1.6

Now, copy cr-1.6.tar.gz to a temporary directory, unpack, build and test.



SourceForge update
==================

Upload tarballs to sourceforge:
   ftp upload.sf.net
   user: anonymous
   passwd: email address
   cd incoming
   bin
   put cr-1.6.tar.gz
   put cr-1.6.zip
   bye

Via "Admin" interface on SF, create a new source release named "Chromium 1.6".
Add the .tar.gz and .zip files to the release.

Send an email to chromium-dev, chromium-users, and chromium-announce.



Finally, tag the cvs tree
=========================

   cd cr
   cvs tag release-A-B-C-YYYYMMDD

   where:
      A-B-C is the version, like 1-4-0
      YYYYMMDD is the year, month, day
