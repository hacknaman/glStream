<h1 class="PageHeading">How Chromium Works</h1>
<p>This document is intended to give an overview of how the various pieces of
Chromium work and what's going on behind the scenes when you do one of these
runs.&nbsp; It will probably be a grab-bag of useful nuggets of information in
no particular order.&nbsp; Hopefully this will be useful if someone wants to
experiment with changing some part of the core architecture instead of just
extending it.</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">The Mothership</h2>
<p>The mothership is usually the first thing that you will run for any Chromium
session.&nbsp; We've already described in detail how the scripts themselves
work, so let's focus on the mothership itself.&nbsp; The guts of the mothership
are invoked by the &quot;<code>Go</code>&quot; method of the <code>CR</code>
objects created in a configuration script.&nbsp; The last line of a Chromium
configuration script will almost always be:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">		cr.Go()</td></tr></table>

<p>This function actually takes a single argument: the port to listen on.&nbsp;
The default port is 10000, but it can sometimes be useful to have the port be an
argument to the script if, for example, sockets take a minute to shut down
properly (like they can on Linux).&nbsp; The <code>Go</code> method will create
a socket on the specified port, and accept connections from (possibly multiple
simultaneous) clients.</p>
<p>The mothership then calls <code>ProcessRequest</code>, which will read a
single line of data from the connected client.&nbsp; This line is split into
words.&nbsp; The first word is considered to be a command, and the rest of the
words are arguments to that command.&nbsp; So, for example, you can connect to
the mothership (just telnet to port 10000) and send the following line:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">		spu 10</td></tr></table>

<p>This will be broken by the mothership into the words &quot;spu&quot; and
&quot;10&quot;.&nbsp; Then, the Python script will build an on-the-fly reference
to a method of the CR class, using Python's reflection API.&nbsp; This is done
by the following lines of <code>ProcessRequest</code> in <code>cr/mothership/server/mothership.py</code>:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">		command = string.lower( words[0] )<br>
		print "command = " + command<br>
		try:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fn = getattr(self, 'do_%s' % command )<br>
		except AttributeError:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.ClientError( sock_wrapper, SockWrapper.UNKNOWNCOMMAND, "Unknown command: %s" % command )<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return<br>
		fn( sock_wrapper, string.join( words[1:] ) )</td></tr></table>

<p>The &quot;<code>getattr</code>&quot; function tries to find a method called,
in our example &quot;<code>do_spu</code>&quot;.&nbsp; If the method is not
found, an error is returned to the calling client.&nbsp; Errors are reported
with a three-digit numeric code and a descriptive string.&nbsp; In this case,
the code <code>SockWrapper.UNKNOWNCOMMAND</code> happens to be 402.&nbsp; This
is a lot like the way HTTP works -- a successful reply actually has the ID 200.</p>
<p>If the function <i>is</i> found, the variable &quot;<code>fn</code>&quot;
becomes a handle to it, and the rest of the arguments are combined into a single
string and passed as arguments to the function.</p>
<p>To continue this example, let's look at the <code>do_spu</code> method:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">		def do_spu( self, sock, args ):<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spuid = int(args)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.ClientError( sock,
      SockWrapper.UNKNOWNSPU, "Bogus SPU name: %s" % args )<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if not allSPUs.has_key( spuid ):<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self.ClientError( sock,
      SockWrapper.UNKNOWNSPU, "Never heard of SPU %d" % spuid )<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sock.SPUid = spuid<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sock.Success( "Hello, SPU!&quot; )</td></tr></table>

<p>This method tries to convert the arguments (in our case, the single string
&quot;10&quot;) into an integer.&nbsp; If the conversion fails, a &quot;Bogus
SPU name&quot; is returned.&nbsp; This can happen if the client says &quot;<code>spu
10.5</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>spu 10 foo</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>spu
clodburger</code>&quot;.&nbsp; Next, the system tries to find the SPU from the
given ID.&nbsp; Each SPU is assigned a unique numeric identifier by the
mothership when it is added to a node; these identifiers are communicated to the
application faker or the server when the SPU is loaded.&nbsp; The ID is then
passed as the first argument to the SPU's <code>SPUInit</code> function.</p>
<p>If the SPU is found, the ID is stored along with the socket, so that
subsequent requests on the same socket are referring to a particular SPU.&nbsp;
This way, to get many configuration settings for a particular SPU, you set the
&quot;current&quot; SPU and then send many &quot;<code>spuparam &lt;param_name&gt;</code>&quot;
commands in succession.</p>
<p>The mothership also has some rudimentary facilities for brokering out-of-band
connections between components, although this is not completely implemented
yet.&nbsp; In fact, the Myrinet implementation of the Chromium networking
abstraction uses what does exist of this facility to establish its
connections.&nbsp; Because Myrinet GM is a completely connectionless API, WireGL
had to have a TCP/IP based handshake occur first in which the two computers
agreed to use Myrinet and exchanged some information related to the
connection.&nbsp; In Chromium, that information is exchanged via the mothership.&nbsp;
This paragraph is deliberately vague because the exact mechanism is likely to
change in the near future.</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">The Server</h2>
<p>The next portion of the system likely to get run is the Chromium
server.&nbsp; The first thing that the server tries to do is figure out where
the mothership is.&nbsp; This can be specified with the &quot;-mothership&quot;
command line option.&nbsp; If this option is omitted, NULL will be passed to <code>crMothershipConnect</code>,
which will cause the mothership library to look for the <code>CRMOTHERSHIP</code>
environment variable, and if that fails to default to &quot;<code>localhost:10000</code>&quot;.&nbsp;
Notice that the format for specifying the location of the mothership is &quot;<code>&lt;host&gt;:port</code>&quot;,
although the port can be omitted.&nbsp; Eventually, the mothership will remotely
invoke the server (and the application faker, which has a similar argument), so
this will be a non-issue.&nbsp; For now, the most likely scenario is that the
mothership will run on the same machine all the time, so you can set the <code>CRMOTHERSHIP</code>
environment variable to just the name of that machine.&nbsp; The mothership <i>requires</i>
TCP/IP to work -- it can not work over GM.</p>
<p>The server next initializes the state tracking and networking subsystems, and
then connects to the mothership to configure itself.&nbsp; It turns out that the
call:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">		crServerGatherConfiguration(mothership);</td></tr></table>

<p>Is actually where the server will wait for clients to connect to it.&nbsp;
Because the mothership knows the connectivity of the node graph, the server
knows how many clients to wait for and what network protocol they will be using,
obviating the need for the WireGL-style handshake.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other interesting thing that happens at the configuration step is that
the server pretends to be one of its clients for a while.&nbsp; The server needs
to know how big the entire logical output space is (to properly handle <code>glViewport</code>
and <code>glScissor</code> calls), but the tile configuration for the server
only tells it about its local pieces.&nbsp; So the server finds out the SPU id
of one of its clients, &quot;poses&quot; as that SPU to the mothership, and asks
to find out about all of the <i>other</i> servers in the current run and their
tilings.&nbsp; It uses this information to find the server with the most
extremal tile boundaries and compute the width and height of the entire logical
output space.</p>
<p>Back in the server's <code>main</code>, a &quot;base projection&quot; is then
computed, which allows the server to place a translate-and-scale matrix at the
top of the projection matrix stack.&nbsp; This is because any screen tiling is
handed by the server, not by an individual SPU.</p>
<p>Next, the server's dispatch table is built (analogous to, but not exactly the
same as, the <a href="codegen.html">seethrough SPU</a>'s <code>seethroughspuBuildFunctionTable</code>
function.&nbsp; The state tracker is told to use this function pointer table
when it computes differences for context switching.</p>
<p>Finally, the server enters its main loop:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">		crServerSerializeRemoteStreams();</td></tr></table>

<p>This function will loop forever and dispatch remote blocks of work to the SPU
chain that it loaded at configuration time.</p>
<p><code>crServerSerializeRemoteStreams</code> is actually a pretty simple
function (it's in <code>cr/crserver/server_stream.c</code>).&nbsp; It gets a
client off the run queue, makes current to that client's context (causing a
context difference to be evaluated), and executes blocks of work for that client
until the client blocks.&nbsp; The code is fairly self-explanatory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The function at the very end of <code>cr/crserver/server_stream.c</code>
merits explanation:</p>

<table width="100%"><tr><td class="GrayCodeListing">		int crServerRecv( CRConnection *conn, void *buf, unsigned int len )<br>
      {<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (void) conn;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (void) buf;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (void) len;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 0; // Never handle anything -- let packets queue up per-client instead.<br>
      }</td></tr></table>

<p>When the networking library is initialized (in <code>main</code>), it is
passed this function as a &quot;handler&quot; for incoming packets.&nbsp; When a
packet is received by the networking library, it makes sure that it is a valid
message in the Chromium protocol, and then passes it immediately to the provided
handler function.&nbsp; If the handler function does something with it, the
function should return 1, and the message will be discarded.&nbsp; If, however,
the handler function <i>does not</i> handle the message, it is passed to the
default message handler. </p>
<p>The default message handler takes care of flow-control messages, reassembling
fragmented packets, and queueing actual blocks of OpenGL work.&nbsp; Since the
server's receive function always returns 0, any work blocks that arrive at the
server are queued up on a linked list stored inside the <code>CRConnection</code>
data structure.<i> </i> So the implementation of <code>crNetGetMessage</code>
(called from <code>crServerSerializeRemoteStreams</code>) simply checks this
queue, and if it is empty it grabs blocks from the networking library until a
block of work arrives on the requested queue.&nbsp; In practice, this scheduling
algorithm has proved to work well, although certainly more sophisticated schemes
would be possible.</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">The Application Faker</h2>
<p>The application faker, or &quot;<code>crappfaker</code>&quot;, is one of the
ugly system-dependent muddy-voodoo pieces of the system that is probably best
left alone.&nbsp; It predates WireGL all the way back to the early <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/pomegranate" target="new_window">Pomegranate</a>
simulations.&nbsp; The job of <code>crappfaker</code> is to launch a child
process in such a way that it will find the Chromium OpenGL DLL.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On Windows, this is accomplished by creating a temporary directory, copying
the executable there, copying <code>crfaker.dll</code> to that directory and
renaming it as <code>opengl32.dll</code>, spawning the executable as a child,
and deleting the directory when the child exits.&nbsp; Of course, if the child
crashes, the directory will not be cleaned, so beware of thousands of copies of
things lying around in temporary directories.</p>
<p>On UNIX, <code>crappfaker</code> is slightly less invasive.&nbsp; It creates
a temporary directory and fills it with appropriately named symbolic links to <code>libcrfaker.so</code>.&nbsp;
It then prepends that temporary directory to the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
environment variable.&nbsp; Then the executable is spawned and the directory
cleaned up (again, unless the executable crashes).</p>
<p><code>crappfaker</code> can also be told where the mothership is on the
command line.&nbsp; A pointer to the faker DLL can be specified explicitly.</p>
<p>crappfaker will set an environment variable called <code>CR_APPLICATION_ID_NUMBER</code>,
which is used by the OpenGL faker DLL to disambiguate itself from other fakers
that might be running on the same machine (which can happen when debugging
parallel programs on a uniprocessor).</p>
<p><code>crappfaker</code> also sets an environment variable called &quot;<code>__CR_LAUNCHED_FROM_APP_FAKER</code>&quot;,
which SPU's can use to tell if they were loaded manually or by the app
faker.&nbsp; This can be useful if the SPU wants to behave in a slightly
different way, or work around a bug.&nbsp; See <code>cr/spu/render/renderspu_window.c</code>
for an example.</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">The OpenGL Faker Library</h2>
<p>This library, called <code>crfaker.dll</code> (or <code>libcrfaker.so</code>
on UNIX) exports the OpenGL API to an application.&nbsp; When a context is
created, the mothership is contacted, and a chain of SPU's is loaded.&nbsp; This
all happens in the function <code>StubInit</code> in <code>cr/opengl_stub/load.c</code>.&nbsp;
Once the SPU's are loaded, the dispatch table from the head SPU is copied into
global variables called &quot;<code>__glim_FuncName</code>&quot; (e.g., <code>__glim_Color3f</code>).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>These variables are used to dispatch the actual OpenGL API to SPU
functions.&nbsp; The dispatch method varies from platform to platform; see <code>cr/opengl_stub/Linux_exports.s</code>
for the most complicated one.</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">The SPU Loader</h2>
<p>The SPU Loader, located in <code>cr/spu/loader</code>, is responsible for
reading a SPU DLL from disk and building a dispatch table for it.&nbsp; It can
also load a chain of SPU's.</p>
<p>Loading a single SPU is pretty straightforward.&nbsp; The SPU DLL is opened
explicitly using <code>crDLLOpen</code>. Then, the SPU's single entry point,
called <code>SPULoad</code>, is extracted and called.&nbsp; This returns several
pieces of information to the loader:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The SPU's name</li>
  <li>The SPU's SuperSPU name</li>
  <li>The SPU's <code>SPUInit</code> function</li>
  <li>The SPU's <code>SPUSelf</code> function</li>
  <li>The SPU's <code>SPUCleanup</code> function (currently unused)</li>
</ul>
<p>The loader will load the SuperSPU first with a recursive call to
itself.&nbsp; Note that the loader will default to loading the Error SPU if no
SuperSPU is provided (unless, of course, the SPU being loaded <i>is </i>the
Error SPU).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then, the <code>SPUInit</code> function is called.&nbsp; This function is
passed the unique SPU ID given to this SPU by the mothership, a pointer to the
(already built) dispatch table for the SPU immediately following the one being
loaded in the chain (the &quot;child&quot; SPU), a pointer to 
its own SPU structure (from which the already-loaded
SuperSPU can be accessed through the <code>-&gt;superSPU</code> member),
and two more (currently unused) arguments.</p>
<p>Based on the named function table returned (see &quot;<a href="newspu.html">Writing
a new SPU</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="codegen.html">Automatically generating
code for a SPU</a>&quot;), the dispatch table is built by the function <code>__buildDispatch</code>,
implemented in <code>cr/spu/loader/dispatch.c</code>.&nbsp; This function will
search for named functions through a chain of SuperSPU's.</p>
<p>The built dispatch table is then passed back to the SPU through the SPUSelf
function.&nbsp; Currently, no SPU's actually use this, although this is a
convenient way to get access to your own built dispatch table (including your
parent's functions, where appropriate) without actually declaring all of your
own functions as &quot;<code>extern</code>&quot; and calling them
explicitly.&nbsp; This would be an improvement over the ugly &quot;<code>extern</code>&quot;
function declarations used in the vertex array implementation in &quot;<a href="codegen.html">Automatically
generating code for a SPU</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>To load a SPU chain, SPU's are simply loaded in reverse order, so we can pass
the built dispatch table for a child to the upstream SPU.</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">The Packer</h2>
<p>The library in cr/packer creates buffers suitable for sending over a network
out of the OpenGL API.&nbsp; It is fairly straightforward, and described in some
detail in our <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/clust_render" target="new_window">Supercomputing
2000 paper</a>.&nbsp; However, Chromium's packer has some interesting quirks
that are worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The packer doesn't interact with the state tracker at all.&nbsp;
    Therefore, in order to pack any function that requires knowledge of state (<code>glArrayElement
    </code>and <code>glTexImage</code> are good examples), the caller of the
    pack function must provide the relevant state structure.&nbsp; This means
    that the burden of properly dispatching things to the state tracker lies
    with the calling SPU, which is a slightly cleaner design.&nbsp; See the
    functions in <code>cr/spu/pack/packspu_pixel.c</code> for an example of this
    usage.</li>
  <li>If you want to maintain multiple buffers for packing (like the TileSort
    SPU does), you need to swap them in and out yourself.&nbsp; The packer
    maintains its own pointers into the global pack buffer to tell it where the
    next opcode and data elements should go.&nbsp; If you are switching between
    pack buffers, you need to extract those pointers so they can be properly put
    back when it's time to switch back again.&nbsp; See <code>cr/spu/tilesort/tilesortspu_flush.c</code>,
    and look for calls to <code>crPackSetBuffer</code> and <code>crPackGetBuffer</code>.</li>
  <li>There are multiple versions of the packing functions for vertices.&nbsp;
    The simple ones (e.g., <code>crPackVertex3f</code>) just pack the vertex,
    and nothing more.&nbsp; There are BBOX packing functions (e.g., <code>crPackVertex3fBBOX</code>)
    that update a geometry bounding box as they pack.&nbsp; This logic is in the
    packer instead of in the tilesorter for two reasons.&nbsp; First, it would
    be inefficient to use an extra function call to keep track of the bounding
    box on the side.&nbsp; Second, other SPU's may want to track bounding box
    information.&nbsp; See the initialization of the <code>bucketInfo</code>
    variable in <code>cr/spu/tilesort/tilesortspu_bucket.c</code> for an example
    of how to get at this data.&nbsp; Finally, functions are available that can
    track the bounding box <i>and</i> count the number of vertices (e.g., <code>crPackVertex3fBBOX_COUNT</code>).&nbsp;
    This is used in the TileSort SPU when the geometry packing buffer fills up
    in the middle of a primitive, since we need to know how many vertices to
    save away for re-issuing in a future buffer.&nbsp; See <code>cr/spu/tilesort/tilesortspu_pinch.c</code>
    (but shield your eyes, this code is complicated).</li>
  <li>The packer will use a callback function to inform the calling library that
    the buffer has filled up.&nbsp; The callback function can be set with <code>crPackFlushFunc</code>,
    and it takes a &quot;<code>void *</code>&quot; argument that can be set with
    <code>crPackFlushArg</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">The Unpacker</h2>
<p>The unpacking library is considerably simpler than the packing library.&nbsp;
It simply walks over a packed buffer, calling the functions of a <code>SPUDispatchTable</code>.&nbsp;
The API to be used is passed to the <code>crUnpack</code> function -- see <code>cr/crserver/server_stream.c</code>
for an example. </p>
<p>The server also uses features of the unpacker to extract &quot;network
pointers&quot;.&nbsp; Network pointers are simply memory addresses that reside
on another machine.&nbsp; Although they're not useful to the server itself, when
the client wants the server to sent it some information, it can put its local
memory address in a packet, and the local memory address will get sent back
along with the response.&nbsp; The networking layer will then take care of
writing the payload data to the specified address.</p>
<p>See <code>spu/pack/packspu_net.c</code> for an example of a non-trivial
receive function (unlike the server's, which always returns 0 to let packets
queue up) and usage of network pointers.</p>
<h2 class="PageSubHeading">The state tracker</h2>
<p>We saw the state tracker in action in the &quot;<a href="codegen.html">Automatically
generating code for a SPU</a>&quot; section.&nbsp; The state tracker is much too
complex to describe every detail here.&nbsp; For a description of how it all
works, read our <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/state_tracking" target="new_window">Eurographics/SIGGRAPH
Hardware Workshop 2000 paper</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The best way to figure out how state tracking works is to actually step
through some of the code.&nbsp; Load an application in the debugger using the
Chromium OpenGL DLL, as described in &quot;<a href="spudebug.html">Debugging a
SPU</a>&quot;.&nbsp; Once the SPU's have been loaded, set breakpoints in various
state calls that you think will happen, and see what they do.&nbsp; In
particular, observing the behavior of <code>crStateDiff</code> in the Tilesort
SPU is very illuminating for the lazy state update process.</p>
