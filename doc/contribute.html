<h1 class="PageHeading">How to Contribute to Chromium</h1>
<p>Chromium is a GPL-licensed open source project.&nbsp; I welcome the
opportunity to make this system better and more universally applicable with the
help of you, the user.&nbsp; There are a number of ways that you can give back
to Chromium:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write new SPU's.&nbsp; Useful, interesting, or just plain cool SPU's can
    easily make it into the main tree.</li>
  <li>Support new networks.&nbsp; The networking model in Chromium is (I hope)
    stable enough that you could write a module to support a new networking
    type, using either the TCP/IP or Myrinet modules as a guide.</li>
  <li>Add support for new OpenGL functionality.&nbsp; Have a favorite
    extension?&nbsp; Take a look at the extensions we've already implemented and
    add some more.</li>
  <li>Combine existing SPU's (or new SPU's) in interesting ways.&nbsp;
    Descriptions of (and configuration files for) new kinds of things that can
    be done with Chromium networked node graphs are quite welcome.</li>
  <li>Port to a new operating system.&nbsp; Not everyone runs Windows or
    Linux.&nbsp; This should be fairly straightforward, and the build system
    will help you by hollering whenever it doesn't know how to do something.</li>
  <li>Add new kinds of functionality to existing SPU's.&nbsp; We're particularly
    interested in seeing off-axis projection support built into Chromium for
    supporting casual arrangements of projectors or CAVE's.&nbsp; We know that a
    couple of groups did this work for WireGL -- hopefully it should be easy to
    put it into the existing Chromium system.&nbsp; If it could be its own SPU,
    that would be ideal, but a modification to the TileSort SPU might make most
    sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have modifications or additions to Chromium that you would like to see
included in the official source tree, you can <a href="mailto:humper@graphics.stanford.edu">send
me mail directly</a> with a proposal or a summary of work already
completed.&nbsp; I hope that Chromium will eventually make a significant
difference in the way large-scale visualization problems are tackled, and user
feedback and contributions will be critical to ensuring the feature-completeness
and robustness that will require.</p>
