<h1 class="PageHeading">Chromium Introduction</h1>
<p>Chromium is a new system for interactive rendering on clusters of
workstations.&nbsp; It is a completely extensible architecture, so that parallel
rendering algorithms can be implemented on clusters with ease.&nbsp; This
release provides the ability to do parallel sort-first rendering in the style of
<a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/software/wiregl">WireGL</a>.&nbsp; Future
releases and contributed modules will make Chromium much more flexible and
powerful.</p>
<p>Even if you're completely happy with your WireGL setup, we recommend
replacing it with Chromium for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Numerous bugs have been found and fixed since the last WireGL release</li>
  <li>The new configuration system will make setting up and reconfiguring your
    tiled display much simpler</li>
</ol>
<p>This documentation is meant to serve as a guide for early adopters of the
Chromium system.&nbsp; <i>The July release is an alpha release!</i>&nbsp; It
will have many bugs in it, and certain features will not work.&nbsp; However,
Chromium cannot be a full success without the participation of the user community,
and early adoption of this technology is the best way to make an impact on the
core design or modules.</p>
<p>Up to this point, Chromium is mainly the product of one graduate student, <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~humper">Greg
Humphreys</a>.&nbsp; However, a few other individuals deserve special
mention.&nbsp; <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~ianbuck/">Ian Buck</a>
wrote the original state tracking and bucketing system for WireGL, which the
Chromium &quot;tilesort&quot; SPU and &quot;state_tracker&quot; library are
loosely based on.&nbsp; Ian has also been in charge of the WireGL release
process and maintenance for its 80+ users.&nbsp; <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~eldridge/">Matthew
Eldridge</a> made significant improvements to WireGL's networking libraries and
the overall system design, and his design philosophy (if not his code) lives on
in Chromium.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ccntech.com/">Chris Niederauer</a> did
most of the implementation of the OpenGL extensions, including all of the
NVIDIA-specific ones.&nbsp; He also designed the Chromium logo and did a lot of
really useful slave labor for us last summer when we were building our
cluster. </p>
