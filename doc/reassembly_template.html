<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Image Reassembly Template</h2>

<p>The image reassembly template is used to setup a configuration in which
the tilesort SPU generates N tiles which are reassembled into a downstream
window.
This template can also be used to configure hardware image assembly
(such as with Lightning-2).
</p>

<p>When you create an image reassembly template you'll be prompted to enter
the number of application nodes, number of rendering nodes and the size
of the display (width and height in tiles).</p>

<p>Clicking on the <em>Edit Template</em> button will open the
image reassembly editor, shown here:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="lightning2_template.gif"></p>

<p>The editor is similar to the tilesort editor and
has many of the same controls.</p>

<p>The mural is depicted as colored tiles.  The tiles are labeled and
colored to indicate the host node for each tile's server.</p>

<p>Good load balancing is essential for this configuration.
By observing the colors of the tiles one can get a feel for how well the
image space is subdivided among the servers.
You want to have an even spatial distribution of servers for good load
balancing.
</p>



<h2>Using the image reassembly template</h2>


<h3>Step 1: Specify the rendering servers</h3>

<p>
Specify the number and names of the rendering servers in your cluster.
Do this with the controls in the upper-left corner of the window.
</p>


<h3>Step 2: Fixed or Variable Image Size?</h3>

<p>
The <b>Fixed or Variable Size Image</b> radio buttons control whether
the recombined image will be of a fixed size or variable size.
If it's a variable size you can choose to either fix the number of
rows and columns or the tile size.
If the rows and columns are fixed then tile tiles size will be free to change.
Conversely, if the tile size is fixed, then the number of rows and columns
will be free to change.
</p>

<p>
The total image size will be displayed below only if you choose the fixed
size option.
</p>


<h3>Step 3: Image and Tile Size</h3>

<p>
The <b>Image Tiles</b> controls set the number of rows and columns of
tiles in the image mural.
This control will be disabled if you chose the variable tile size above.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Tile Size</b> controls set the individual tile size.
You can choose a predefined tile size or enter any custom size.
This control will be disabled if you chose the variable tile size option
above.
</p>


<h3>Step 4: Tile Layout</h3>

<p>
The <b>Tile Layout</b> control determines how the tiles within the mural are
laid out.
<br>
Raster order uses a simple top-to-bottom, left-to-right ordering.
<br>
Zig-zag order is like raster order except the left-to-right and
right-to-left order is used for the even and odd rows, respectively.
<br>
Spiral order starts laying out tiles in the center of the mural, and
grows in an outward, clockwise spiral.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above, it's important to choose a good tile layout for
the sake of load balancing.
</p>


<h3>Step 5: Final Image Reassembly</h3>

<p>
There are three options for final image reassembly:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>No reassembly</b> - you'd probably use this if you have a hardware
image compositor (such as Lightning-2) available.
The tiles are rendered by each server and stay there.
<li><b>Reassemble into render SPU window</b> - the image tiles on each
server will be sent downstream (via readback SPU) to a downstream
node which hosts a render SPU.
The reassembled image will appear in the render SPU's window.
<li><b>Reassemble into application window</b> - again, a downstream
node with a render SPU will collect the image tiles.
However, instead of displaying the reassembled image in the render SPU's
window it will be shown in the original application window.
</ul>


<h3>Other options</h3>

<p>
Here are some other things which you'll probably want to pay
attention to.
</p>

<p>
Readback SPU window geometry:
You'll typically want to set the <b>fullscreen</b> option so that each
server has maximum window space for its tiles.
</p>

<p>
Note that other SPU options, such as <b>resizable</b> will be set
automatically when you use the controls described above in steps 1 - 5.
