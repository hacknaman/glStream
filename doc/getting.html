<h1 class="PageHeading">Getting Chromium</h1>

<p>Chromium is maintained at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chromium">SourceForge</a>.&nbsp;
In addition to the source code, you'll also find a bug tracking system and three
mailing lists.&nbsp; Even if you're not a developer, you may wish to subscribe
to chromium-announce to receive information about updated releases.</p>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Obtaining source code</h2>

<p>To get the source code, you do <i>not</i> have to be a registered SourceForge
user.&nbsp; You can get the source in one of two ways:</p>
<p>First, you can download the actual alpha release snapshot, which is available
from the <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chromium">main
project page</a>, under &quot;Latest File Releases&quot;.&nbsp; This will be a
gzip'ed tar file of the entire source tree on the release date, along with a
copy of this documentation.&nbsp; Simply extract the archive and you've got
everything.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can check out the top-of-tree source code from the CVS
repository, if you want to live on the bleeding edge.&nbsp; Between the time of
this release and the BETA release scheduled for October, many bugs will surely
be fixed, and many new features and modules will be added.&nbsp; Announcements
will be sent to chromium-announce when particularly interesting features are
available or particularly bad bugs are fixed.&nbsp; To check out the source
code, just follow the instructions on the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=16529">CVS repository
page</a>.&nbsp; If you're unfamiliar with CVS, useful documentation is
available in <i><a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/cvsbook.html">Open Source
Development with CVS</a></i>.</p>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Compiling the source</h2>

<p>All of Chromium lives under a directory called &quot;<code>cr</code>&quot;.&nbsp; Change
to that directory, and type &quot;<code>make</code>&quot;.&nbsp; You will need <a href="http://www.python.org">Python
2.0</a> or later, and <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl 5.0</a> or later to
build on any platform.&nbsp; Binaries are put in <code> cr/bin/&lt;ARCH&gt;</code>, where
<code>
&lt;ARCH&gt;</code> is the name of your architecture (Actually, it's what's
returned by the &quot;<code>uname</code>&quot; command.&nbsp; Except on
Windows, where <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">cygwin's</a>
&quot;<code>uname</code>&quot; returns something long and silly, so it gets
re-written to &quot;<code>WIN_NT</code>&quot;.).&nbsp; You should add this
directory to your <code>PATH</code>.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you do not have <a href="http://www.myri.com/scs/index.html">Myrinet
GM libraries</a>, you should turn off GM support in the file <code>cr/util/Makefile</code>
before building.&nbsp; There are instructions in that file.</p>
<p>Platform specific notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any UNIX: Shared libraries will be put in the directory <code> cr/lib/&lt;ARCH&gt;</code>.
    You will need to add this directory to your <code> LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment
    variable.&nbsp; Chromium builds a <i>lot</i> of shared libraries, so you
    can't skip this step.</li>
  <li>Windows:&nbsp; You will also need to install the <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">cygwin
    tools</a> to build Chromium.&nbsp; If you're building from the Windows shell
    (as opposed to the cygwin bash implementation), you will need to set the
    environment variable &quot;<code>MAKE_MODE</code>&quot; to the string &quot;<code>unix</code>&quot;.&nbsp;
    This lets <code>gmake</code> use <code> bash</code> as its subshell instead of the Windows shell,
    which is required.&nbsp; Shared libraries on Windows get put in <code>cr/bin/WIN_NT</code>,
    which (since it's on your path, right?) will be searched automatically, so
    there's no <code> LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> silliness.</li>
  <li>IRIX:&nbsp; GNU make is required.  Build Chromium by typing
    <code>gmake</code> instead of <code>make</code>.
  <li>AIX:&nbsp;
    Shared libraries are somewhat different on this platform.  For Cr clients
    and servers to run, a dlopen-able system GL is needed.  At present, do this
    (once) manually (ar -x /usr/lib/libGL.a && mv shr.o libGL.o ) . Set
    CR_SYSTEM_GL_PATH to the directory with libGL.o  for AIX clients and
    servers.
    <br>
    The exec loader will continue to look for .a's (rather, shared objects in
    ar archives) and .so's.  So to run clients without the app_faker, prepend
    LIBPATH with a dir that has a link libGL.a ->  lib/AIX/libcrfaker.a . As
    with other platforms, you also need to set the CR_APPLICATION_ID_NUMBER  .
  <li>Darwin:&nbsp;
    Support for this operating system is not complete.

</ul>
