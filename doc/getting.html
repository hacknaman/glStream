<p align="center"><font size="7">Getting Chromium</font></p>
<p>Chromium is maintained at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chromium" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>.&nbsp;
In addition to the source code, you'll also find a bug tracking system and three
mailing lists.&nbsp; Even if you're not a developer, you may wish to subscribe
to chromium-announce to receive information about updated releases.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5">Obtaining source code</font></p>
<p>To get the source code, you do <i>not</i> have to be a registered SourceForge
user.&nbsp; You can get the source in one of two ways:</p>
<p>First, you can download the actual alpha release snapshot, which is available
from the <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chromium" target="_blank">main
project page</a>, under &quot;Latest File Releases&quot;.&nbsp; This will be a
gzip'ed tar file of the entire source tree on the release date, along with a
copy of this documentation.&nbsp; Simply extract the archive and you've got
everything.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can check out the top-of-tree source code from the CVS
repository, if you want to live on the bleeding edge.&nbsp; Between the time of
this release and the BETA release scheduled for October, many bugs will surely
be fixed, and many new features and modules will be added.&nbsp; Announcements
will be sent to chromium-announce when particularly interesting features are
available or particularly bad bugs are fixed.&nbsp; To check out the source
code, just follow the instructions on the &quot;CVS repository&quot; link near
the bottom of the <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/chromium" target="_blank">main
project page</a>.&nbsp; If you're unfamiliar with CVS, useful documentation is
available in &quot;Open Source Development with CVS&quot;.&nbsp; Most of the
technical documentation in this book is free under the terms of the GPL, and is
available from <a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com" target="_blank">cvsbook.red-bean.com</a></p>
<p align="center"><font size="5">Compiling the source</font></p>
<p>All of Chromium lives under a directory called &quot;cr&quot;.&nbsp; Change
to that directory, and type 'make'.&nbsp; You will need <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python
2.0</a> or later, and <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl 5.0</a> or later to
build on any platform.&nbsp; Binaries are put in cr/bin/&lt;ARCH&gt;, where
&lt;ARCH&gt; is the name of your architecture (actually, it's what's returned by
the &quot;uname&quot; command).&nbsp; You should add this directory to your
PATH.&nbsp; (On Windows, <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">cygwin's</a>
&quot;uname&quot; returns something long and silly, so it gets re-written to
&quot;WIN_NT&quot;).</p>
<p>NOTE: If you do not have <a href="http://www.myri.com/scs/index.html">Myrinet
GM libraries</a>, you should turn off GM support in the file &quot;cr/util/Makefile&quot;
before building.&nbsp; There are instructions in that file.</p>
<p>Platform specific notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any UNIX: Shared libraries will be put in the directory cr/lib/&lt;ARCH&gt;.
    You will need to add this directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
    variable.&nbsp; Chromium builds a <i>lot</i> of shared libraries, so you
    can't skip this step.</li>
  <li>Windows:&nbsp; You will also need to install the <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">cygwin
    tools</a> to build Chromium.&nbsp; If you're building from the Windows shell
    (as opposed to the cygwin bash implementation), you will need to set the
    environment variable &quot;MAKE_MODE&quot; to the string &quot;unix&quot;.&nbsp;
    This makes gmake use bash as its subshell instead of the Windows shell,
    which is required.&nbsp; Shared libraries on Windows get put in cr/bin/WIN_NT,
    which (since it's on your path, right?) will be searched automatically, so
    there's no LD_LIBRARY_PATH silliness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Chromium version ALPHA does not support byte-swapping of arguments,
so all machines involved in the cluster have to have the same endianness.&nbsp;
This simply means that you can't (currently) render between IRIX and
Linux.&nbsp; This will be fixed for the next release.</p>
