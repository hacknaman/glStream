<h1 class="PageHeading">Adding OpenGL Extensions to Chromium</h1>
<p>In order to use particular OpenGL extensions in your OpenGL application,
Chromium must explicitly implement those extensions.  This page describes
how OpenGL extensions are implemented in Chromium and how to add new ones.</p>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Compile-time extension support</h2>
<p>The <code>include/cr_versions.h</code> file defines a preprocessor
token for each extension Chromium supports.  For example:</p>
<pre>
#define CR_ARB_multitexture 1
#define CR_ARB_texture_cube_map 1
#define CR_EXT_blend_color 1
#define CR_EXT_blend_minmax 1
#define CR_EXT_blend_subtract 1
</pre>
<p>Most Chromium client programs are ordinary OpenGL applications and should
use the <code>GL_</code>-prefixed tokens to test for extensions.
However, Chromium-specific applications may use these tokens if needed.</p>

<p>Internally, Chromium uses these tokens to determine which OpenGL extensions
should be enabled.  If one wants to disable a particular extension in
Chromium you can simply comment-out the appropriate <code>#define</code>.</p>

<p>When adding a new extension to chromium you should surround all the new
code for that extension with <code>#ifdef CR_(extension name)</code> and
<code>#endif</code>.</p>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Run-time extension support</h2>
<p>At runtime, Chromium clients should use <code>glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS)</code>
to determine if extensions are supported.</p>
<p>Internally, Chromium will compute the extension string by examining the
extensions supported by each back-end OpenGL implementation, finding the
intersection, and propogating the list up through the SPU DAG to be sure
the extensions are supported by all the Chromium SPUs.</p>
<p>Extension strings and OpenGL limits like maximum texture size and
number of light sources for each SPU are stored in the mothership.  When
each SPU is initialized it reports its OpenGL extensions and limits to
the mothership.  Some SPUs, like the tilesort SPU, will query the mothership
for its children/server SPU limits in order to determine its own limits.</p>

<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Adding new extensions</h2>
<p>Here are the steps for adding a new extension to Chromium:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add a new <code>CR_</code>* token to <code>include/cr_versions.h</code>.
  <li>Add a new GLboolean field to the <code>CRExtensionState</code> structure
      in the <code>include/state_cr_extensions.h</code> file.
  <li>Add new code in <code>crStateExtensionsInit()</code>
      in <code>spu/state_tracker/state_extensions.c</code> to initialize the
      new boolean.
      Update the extension strings in
      <code>spu/state_tracker/state_limits.c</code> as well.
  <li>Implement the new code for the extension as needed throughout Chromium.
      Specifically, the packer, unpacker and state tracker are the major
      modules which need updating.
      The best advice here is to look at existing extensions for ideas.
  <li>Extensions which only add new tokens to existing functions are easiest
      to implement.  Often, only the state tracker needs to be updated.
  <li>Extensions which add new OpenGL functions are more work.  The OpenGL
      API dispatcher is defined by the functions in
      <code>cr/glapi_parser/system_header/CR_GL.H</code>.  New API functions
      must be added there.
  <li>The code for new extensions should be surrounded by
      <code>#ifdef CR_(extension_name)</code> and <code>#endif</code> so that
      it can be disabled if desired.
      See the <code>GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_ARB</code> clause in
      <code>__enableSet()</code> in <code>spu/state_tracker/state_enable.c</code>
      for an example.
</ol>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Application-only extensions</h2>
<p>
A short-cut to adding new extensions is to implment them for the
application-side only.
This means that the extension can only be used by
SPUs running on the application node (such as the render SPU or readback
SPU when using a sort-last configuration).
Examples of current application-only extensions are GL_NV_vertex_program
and GL_NV_fence.
</p>
<p>
Basically, only the OpenGL API dispatcher needs to be updated.
The extension should be added to the <code>__stateAppOnlyExtensions</code>
string in <code>state_tracker/state_limits.c</code>.
