<h1 class="PageHeading">Chromium Graphical Configuration Tool</h1>
<p>The Chromium graphical configuration tool (hereafter called the config
tool) allows one to build a Chromium configuration with a GUI-based
interface, instead of writing Python configuration files.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot showing a simple tile-sort configuration:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="configtool.gif"></p>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Setup</h2>

<p>The config tool is written in Python and uses the wxWindows GUI
toolkit.</p>

<p>
On a Linux system, you'll need the wxGTK and wxPython libraries.
If you're using Red Hat Linux the <code>wxGTK-2.3.2-1</code> and
<code>wxPython-2.3.2.1-1</code> RPMs are known to work.
</p>

<p>
On a Windows system, (finish this).
</p>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Nodes</h2>

<p>Application nodes are represented by green boxes and network/server
nodes are represented by red boxes.
Each node icon may contain an SPU chain, shown as a sequence of gray boxes.
Nodes and SPUs are labeled accordingly.
</p>

<p>Application and network/server nodes may be created with the
<b>New App Node(s)</b> and <b>New Server Node(s)</b> buttons.
You can create 1, 2, 3, 4 or N instances of either type of node.
</p>

<p>Nodes may be selected and moved using the mouse.
Selected nodes have a thick black outline.
You may extend the selection by <em>shift-clicking</em>.
You can toggle the selection status of a node by <em>control-clicking</em>.
</p>

<p>The <b>Node</b> menu has commands that apply to the currently
selected nodes.
</p>

<p><em>Compound nodes</em> are a compact way to represent a set of many
similar nodes.
For example, if your configuration has 8 rendering nodes, you may represent
them using a single compound node, rather than 8 individual nodes.
A compound node looks like this:
</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="compoundnode.gif"></p>

<p>The compound node displays a count which indicates how may nodes are
represented by the icon.
You can change the count with the <b>Node / Node Count</b> menu item.
Compount nodes may be split into a set of individual, non-compound
nodes with the <b>Node / Split</b> menu item.
A set of similar, individual nodes may be combined into a compound node
with the <b>Node / Merge</b> menu item.
</p>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">SPUs</h2>

<p>Nodes contain SPU chains.  SPU chains are seen as one or more gray,
labeled boxes inside node icons.
</p>

<p>To add a new SPU to a node, first select the node, then choose the
SPU type from the <b>New SPU</b> button.
If no SPUs are currently selected in the node, the new SPU will be added
to the end of the SPU chain.
If one or more SPUs are currently selected in the node, the new SPU will
be added in front of the selected SPU.
</p>

<p>As with nodes, SPUs may be selected and deselected by clicking on them
with the mouse.  The <em>shift</em> and <em>control</em> keys may be used
while clicking to extend and toggle selection status, respectively.</p>

<p>The <b>SPU</b> menu has commands that apply to the currently selected SPUs.
The <b>SPU / Options</b> menu item will open a dialog which allows you to
configure the selected SPUs.</p>


<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Client / Server Connections</h2>

<p>Some SPUs (such as pack and tilesort) have a packer which allows them
to be connected to downstream servers.
Such SPUs have a black, rectangular <em>socket</em> on their right edge.
Similarly, servers have a black, rectangular <em>socket</em> on their
left edge.
Connections between packing SPUs and servers are drawn as blue lines.</p>

<p>To connect nodes (i.e. connect a packing SPU to a server node) use the
<b>Node / Connect</b> menu item.
You must have at least two nodes selected, one must be a server and
the other must have an SPU chain that ends with a packing SPU.</p>

<p>If more than two SPUs are selected, the configuration tool will do
its best to determine the desired connection topology, but it may make
mistakes.</p>

<p>Two nodes may be disconnected by selecting the nodes and choosing
the <b>Node / Disconnect</b> menu item.<p>



<h2 class="PageSubHeading">Templates</h2>

<p>Templates allow one to quickly create common Chromium configurations
without having to create individual nodes, SPUs and connections.
To instantiate a template, choose the desired template from the
<b>New Template</b> button.</p>

<p>When you instantiate a template you'll often be prompted for a few
parameters such as number of application nodes, mural rows and columns, etc.
The configuration will be generated when you click on <b>OK</b> button.
</p>

<p>Templates may be edited with special, easy-to-use dialogs.
Click on the <b>Edit Template</b> button to open the editor, if supported.
</p>

<p>Currently, there are templates for tile-sort, sort-last and Lightning-2
configurations.
