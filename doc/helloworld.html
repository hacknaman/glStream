<h1 class="PageHeading">Your First Chromium Run</h1>
<p>Your first Chromium run will be something quite simple.&nbsp; One of the
programs built during the compile of the Chromium system is called &quot;<code>fonttest</code>&quot; -
you can go ahead and run it now.&nbsp; If everything is OK, you should see a
window appear with a text message in it.&nbsp; This window is using the system's
OpenGL - nothing Chromium-related has happened yet.&nbsp; To run this program
using Chromium, you will need to follow these four steps (you'll need three
shell windows open):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set up your search path.<br>
    <br>
    The Chromium executable programs are located in
    <code>cr/bin/<em>ARCH</em>/</code>.
    On Linux, for example, it'll be <code>cr/bin/Linux/</code>.
    If you're using Unix you should edit your <code>.cshrc</code> or
    <code>.bash</code> or similar shell start-up file and add
    <code>cr/bin/<em>ARCH</em>/</code> to the search path.<br>
    <br>
    If you don't do this you'll have to provide the full path to the
    crserver and crappfaker programs below.<br>
    <br>
    
  <li>Start the mothership.<br>
    <br>
    Components of any Chromium run will need to know what they are supposed to be
    doing.&nbsp; They get this information from the <i>configuration mothership</i>.&nbsp;
    The mothership is controlled by scripts written in the <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>
    programming language.&nbsp; One such script is located in <code> cr/mothership/configs/crdemo.conf</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Change to the <code> cr/mothership/configs</code> directory, and type:<br>
    <br>
    <code>python crdemo.conf fonttest</code><br>
    <br>
    The mothership will now be running, and you should see a message to that
    effect.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>Start a Chromium server.<br>
    <br>In another window run<br>
    <br>
    <code>crserver</code><br>
    <br>
    That's all there is to it.&nbsp; The Chromium server will configure itself
    by asking questions to the mothership that you ran in step 1.&nbsp;
    The server will dispatch the incoming stream of commands to the first
    SPU hosted by the server (the Render SPU in this case).
    Note: previous versions of Chromium would open a window at this point.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Start the application.<br>
    <br>
    In a third window, start the Chromium &quot;application
    faker&quot;.&nbsp; This is a loader program that will start another
    unmodified application and make sure that it finds the Chromium
    OpenGL shared library instead of the system's.&nbsp; Run<br>
    <br>
    <code>crappfaker</code><br>
    <br>
    Again, the faker (and the OpenGL DLL, and the SPU's loaded by the OpenGL
    DLL) will all configure themselves by asking questions of the mothership
    started in step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once application starts you should see two windows appear: the Render SPU
window and the application window.
The application window belongs to the <code>fonttest</code>
program started by the application faker.&nbsp; As far as
<code>fonttest</code> knows, it is rendering to that window.&nbsp;
The Chromium OpenGL DLL intercepts all of <code>fonttest</code>'s calls to OpenGL and sends
them over the network (in this case, a TCP/IP connection to your local machine)
to the Chromium server, where they are dispatched to the system.</p> <p>The
Chromium run you have just done corresponds to the following graph of
nodes:</p>

<h1 class="PageHeading">Other Sample Configurations</h1>

<p>
The Chromium distribution includes many sample configurations to demonstrate
the capabilities of Chromium.
Here's a summary.
The scripts are found in mothership/configs/.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>crdemo.conf</b> - this is the configuration described above.
One application node is connected (via a pack or tilesort SPU) to one
crserver node which has a render SPU.</p>

<li><p><b>local.conf</b> - this configuration demonstrates OpenGL command
filtering.
A single application node has a hiddenline SPU and a render SPU.
The hiddenline SPU manipulates the OpenGL command stream to render the
demo program's geometry in an outline mode.</p>

<li><p><b>blur.conf</b> - another example of OpenGL command filtering.
This one demontrates the motion blur SPU.</p>

<li><p><b>simplemural.conf</b> - this configuration demonstrates a two-tile
tilesort configuration.
The application node has a tilesort SPU which sends commands to two
crserver nodes, each with a render SPU.</p>

<li><p><b>reassemble.conf</b> - this configuration demonstrates the tilesort
SPU and the render SPU's ability to render back into the application's
window (on X only; not Windows). 
The application node uses a tilesort SPU to talk to two crservers.
Each crserver has a readback SPU.
The readback SPUs render into the original application window, rather
than separate windows.</p>
<p>This configuration also demonstrates dynamic retiling.  When the application
window is resized, the tilesort SPU's tiling is changed.</p>

<li><p><b>psubmit_last.conf</b> - a demonstration of sort-last parallel
rendering.  Two application nodes, each with a read back SPU, render part
of the scene.  The partial renderings are sent by pack SPUs to the final
crserver node's render SPU where the images are Z-composited together.
The demo can be modified to use more than two application instances.</p>

<li><p><b>psubmit_first.conf</b> - demonstration of combining tilesort
(sort-first) with sort-last rendering.
The two application nodes each render half the scene and use the tilesort
SPU to send rendering commands to two crserver nodes.</p>

<li><p><b>psubmit_bswap.conf</b> - demonstration of sort-last rendering
with the binary swap SPU.</p>

<li><p><b>multitilesort.conf</b> - demonstration of a two-level tilesort
configuration.</p>

<li><p><b>stereo[1234].conf</b> - demontrations of various
<a href="stereo.html">stereo rendering</a>
solutions.  See the comments in each file for details.</p>

<li><p><b>cavetest[12].conf</b> - demonstrations of
<a href="nonplanar.html">non-planar tilesorting</a>.
See the comments in each file for details.</p>

<li><p><b>crut_*.conf</b> - demonstrations of <a href="crut.html">CRUT</a>

<li><p><b>threadtest.conf</b> - demonstration of several multi-threaded
rendering methods.  See the file's comments for details.</p>

<li><p><b>dmx.conf</b> - a simple demonstration of <a href="dmx.html">DMX</a>
support.</p>

</ul>

<p>
There are lots of other samples to look at in the same directory.
