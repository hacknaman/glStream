/*
 * New (version 1.4) buffer pool implementation.
 *
 * Now, each buffer in the pool can be a different size.
 * We only return a buffer from crBufferPoolPop() if we have exactly
 * the right size buffer.
 *
 * Note: the old implementation had a 'max buffers' parameter but it
 * really wasn't good for anything since we always grew the buffer pool
 * if we pushed a new buffer that would cause use to exceed the limit.
 * That's gone now.
 *
 * We're just using a simple linked list here.  Since we seldom have
 * more than about 10-15 buffers in the pool, that's OK.  A binary tree
 * would be nicer though.
 *
 * MCH: BufferPoolPop will now return the smallest buffer in the pool that
 *      is >= to the size required.  This fixes BufferPool overruns with lots
 *      of MTUs.
